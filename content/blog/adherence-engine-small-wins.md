# The Adherence Engine — Why Small Wins Compound Faster Than Perfect Plans

We obsess over the minimum effective plan — the smallest set of actions that compound. This article shows how to build an adherence engine: daily check-ins, weekly reviews, and plans that get kinder as they get smarter.

## Why adherence beats sophistication

Sophisticated plans look impressive. Adherent plans create results. Your system should optimize for consistency first, novelty last.

## Daily check-ins

- 1–3 focus tasks drawn from an active plan
- quick emotive signals (mood/energy)
- an optional one-line note

## Weekly reviews

- summarize journals and check-ins
- celebrate what worked
- pick one small adjustment for next week

## Plan evolution

- adjust intensities and anchors based on adherence
- prefer simpler plans that you can keep

## Conclusion

Build small wins into the structure itself. That’s what compounds.
