title: Body Foundations — Training, Nutrition, Recovery
description: Practical, evidence-aligned foundations for strength, health, and energy.

## Principles
- Progressive overload for strength and capacity
- Protein, fiber, and hydration as anchors
- Sleep as the master recovery variable

## Weekly Structure
- 2–4x strength sessions (full-body focus)
- 1–2x Zone 2 cardio; optional intervals
- Daily steps (8–10k baseline) and mobility

## Nutrition
- Protein ~1.6–2.2 g/kg; fiber 25–35 g/day
- Whole foods first; plan around anchors (breakfast/lunch/dinner)
- Consistent hydration; alcohol minimal

## Recovery
- 7–9 h sleep; wind-down routine; dark, cool room
- Deload weeks after heavy cycles; walking and light mobility

## Safety
