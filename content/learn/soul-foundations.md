title: Soul Foundations — Values, Mission, Alignment
description: Build a life that feels true — on purpose and with compassion.

## Clarify
- Values inventory; write what matters in plain language
- Mission draft: who you serve, how, and why

## Align
- Weekly actions traced to values/mission
- Presence practices: gratitude, meaningful conversations, time in nature

## Review
- Monthly reflection: what felt true? what needs pruning?
- Service as a practice — small acts count
